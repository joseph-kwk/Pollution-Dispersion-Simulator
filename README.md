# Pollution Dispersion Simulator

An interactive 2D fluid simulation tool that visualizes the dispersion of pollutants in a fluid environment. This web-based application helps users understand how pollutants spread under different wind conditions and diffusion rates.

## Features

- 2D grid-based fluid simulation
- Real-time visualization of pollutant dispersion
- Interactive pollution source placement
- Adjustable parameters:
  - Wind direction and speed
  - Diffusion rate
  - Pollution release rate
- Start/Pause/Reset simulation controls
- Responsive design

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Use the control panel to adjust simulation parameters
4. Click on the canvas to place the pollution source
5. Use the control buttons to start, pause, or reset the simulation
