Fluid Simulation with phi.flow and Venom Extraction Concept (Instructions Only)
This guide provides a basic setup for a 2D fluid simulation using the phi.flow library in Python, extended to include a conceptual model for extracting and visualizing a substance like "venom" from a point source.

1. Setup and Installation
First, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the phi.flow library.

Purpose: To get the necessary tools and define the simulation space.

2. Initial Conditions & Visualization Setup
We'll start with a Taylor-Green vortex pattern for the fluid velocity, as demonstrated in the video. We also introduce a density field to track our "venom."

Purpose: To set the initial state of the fluid and prepare for plotting.

3. The Simulation Step (make_step function)
This function defines how the fluid and venom evolve over one time step. It includes advection (movement), diffusion (spreading), pressure correction (incompressibility), and your custom "venom source."

Purpose: To define the core physics and the addition of venom.

4. Running the Simulation and Animation
Finally, we'll iterate the make_step function and create an animation to visualize the fluid flow and the spreading venom.

Purpose: To execute the simulation and create a dynamic visual output.

This setup gives you a starting point. You can experiment with:

Changing the coordinates for the venom source and its injection strengths.
Modifying the direction of the injected velocity to simulate a "jet" of venom.
Adding more complex boundary conditions if the venom needs to exit a specific "tube" or "nozzle."
Adjusting fluid viscosity and time step to see how it affects the flow and mixing.
Exploring different colormaps for the venom density.
